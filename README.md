# PauliPropagation.jl
`PauliPropagation.jl` is a Julia package for simulating Pauli propagation in quantum circuits and systems. It focuses on simulating the evolution of observables expressed in the Pauli basis under the action of (unitary and non-unitary) gates in a quantum circuit.

Unlike traditional simulation approaches that evolve quantum states in the Schrödinger picture, Pauli propagation often works in the Heisenberg picture, evolving observables like $\mathcal{E}^\dagger(\hat{O})$ rather than states $\mathcal{E}(\rho)$, where $\mathcal{E}$ is a quantum circuit. This can be particularly efficient when the observables remain sparse or structured under evolution, and is useful for studying operator dynamics, estimating expectation values, and computing correlation functions.

Pauli propagation is related to the so-called (extended) stabilizer simulation, but is fundamentally different from, for example, tensor networks. It offers a distinct approach that can handle different regimes of quantum complexity.

Implemented in Julia, `PauliPropagation.jl` combines high-performance computation (using features such as multiple dispatch) with an accessible and high-level interface.  

## Installation

> Note the current package requires `Julia 1.10+`.

The `PauliPropagation.jl` package is registered and can be installed into your environment in the following way:
```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("PauliPropagation")
```

### Install from GitHub
If you want to install the latest code, you can install the package directly from the Github link.
For example, if you are working with a Jupyter notebook, run
```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/MSRudolph/PauliPropagation.jl.git", rev="branchname")
```
where you can use the keyword `rev="branchname"` to install development versions of the package.
We don't recommend using branches other than `main` or `dev`.

### Clone the repository and install locally 
Navigate to a local directory where you want to clone this repository into and run the following in a terminal
```bash
git clone git@github.com:MSRudolph/PauliPropagation.jl.git
```
Inside this cloned repository, you can now freely import `PauliPropagation` or install it into your environment.\
Alternatively, you can push the relative path to the cloned repository to the Julia package load path called `LOAD_PATH` via
```julia
rel_path = "your/relative/path/PauliPropagation"
push!(LOAD_PATH,rel_path);
```
This may require that you have no global installation of `PauliPropagation` in your enviroment.

### A note on installing Julia 
It is recommended to install julia using `juliaup` with instructions from [here](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup). Then, Julia's _long-term support_ version (currently a `1.10` version) can be installed via

```juliaup add lts```

To get started running Jupyter notebooks, start a Julia session and install the `IJulia` package.

If you are working on several projects with potentially conflicting packages, it is recommended to work with within local environments or projects.

For more details, we refer to this useful [guide](https://modernjuliaworkflows.org/writing/).

## Quick Start

You can find detailed example notebooks in the `examples` folder. We provide a brief example of how to use `PauliPropagation.jl`.

Consider simulating the dynamics of an operator $O=Z_{16}$ under the evolution of a unitary  channel $\mathcal{E}(\cdot) = U^\dagger \cdot U$ in a $n=32$ qubits system. 

```julia
using PauliPropagation

nqubits = 32

observable = PauliString(nqubits, :Z, 16) # I...IZI...I
```

Our goal is to compute

```math
\text{Tr}[U^\dagger O U \rho].
```

A simple unitary $U$ is the brickwork circuit, composed of two qubit gates alternating neighbouring sites. We define the circuit connectivity by 

```julia
topology = bricklayertopology(nqubits; periodic=true)
```

where `periodic` specifies the boundary condition of the gates. The library has built-in circuits with e.g. a circuit containing alternating RX and RZZ Pauli gates on the topology. This can be defined by Trotterization of a transverse field Ising Hamiltonian with $l$ steps

```math
U = \prod_{a=1}^{l} \prod_{j=1}^n e^{-i dt   X_j} e^{-i dt Z_j Z_{j+1}}.
```

```julia
nlayers = 32 # l as above

circuit = tfitrottercircuit(nqubits, nlayers; topology=topology)
```

In our simulations, we can choose the circuit parameter $dt$

```julia
dt = 0.1 # time step

parameters = ones(countparameters(circuit)) * dt # all parameters
```
**Important:** The circuit and parameters are defined in the order that they would act in the Schrödinger picture. Within our `propagate()` function, the order will be _reversed_ to act on the observable. 

During the propagation via `propagate()`, we employ truncation strategies such as coefficient or weight truncations, these options can be specified as keywords. 

```julia
## the truncations
max_weight = 6 # maximum Pauli weight

min_abs_coeff = 1e-4 # minimal coefficient magnitude

## propagate through the circuit
pauli_sum = propagate(circuit, observable, parameters; max_weight, min_abs_coeff)
```
The output `pauli_sum` gives us an approximation of propagated Pauli strings

```math
U^\dagger O U \approx \sum_{\alpha} c_{\alpha} P_{\alpha}
```

Finally we can compute expectation values with an initial state such as $\rho = (|0 \rangle  \langle 0 |)^{\otimes n}$
```julia
## overlap with the initial state
overlapwithzero(pauli_sum)
# yields 0.154596728241...
```

This computation is efficient because the initial state can be written in terms of only $\mathbb{I}$ and $Z$ strings

```math
\rho = (\frac{\mathbb{I} + Z}{2})^{\otimes n}
```

Therefore, the trace is equivalent to the sum over the coefficients of Pauli strings containing only `I` and `Z` Paulis, 

```math
\mathrm{Tr}[U^\dagger O U \rho] \approx \sum_{\alpha \in \{\mathbb{I}, Z\}\, \text{strings}} c_{\alpha}.
```

## Important Notes and Caveats
All of the following points can be addressed by you writing the necessary missing code due to the nice extensibility of Julia.
- The order of gates and their parameters is aligned with many other packages evolving quantum states in the Schrödinger picture. This order is _reversed_ within our `propagate()` function to act in the Heisenberg picture.
- Consequently, the default is the Heisenberg _backpropagation_ of Pauli strings. Schrödinger propagation may soon be natively supported. At this moment, there are options to transpose `PauliRotation` gates by multiplying their angles with `-1` and `CliffordGate`s by using `transposecliffordmap()`, in addition to having to reverse the order of the circuit.
- We currently do not support the strong simulation of quantum states in non-exponential time (even for Stabilizer states). Pauli propagation could in principle be used as a backend for extended stabilizer simulation.
- Sampling quantum states is currently not supported.
- Many underlying data structures and functions can be used for other purposes involving Pauli operators.

## Upcoming Features
This package is still work-in-progress. You will probably find certain features that you would like to have and that are currently missing.\
Here are some features that we want to implement in the future. Feel free to contribute!
- **Multi-threading and improved scalability**. Currently, PauliPropagation.jl works uses a single CPU thread and may run your hardware out of memory. Future versions should be even faster and with options to trade-off computational runtime and memory requirements. 
- **Easier Schrödinger picture propagation**. Currently, the default is Heisenberg and there is no easy way to transpose the gates.
- **A fast and flexible Surrogate version**. Currently, we provide a version of the Pauli propagation Surrogate that is _good_ and _works_, at least for Pauli gates and Clifford gates. Stay tuned for a whole lot more.
