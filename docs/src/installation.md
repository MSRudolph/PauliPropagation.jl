# Installation

The `PauliPropagation.jl` package is registered and can be installed into your environment in the following way:
```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("PauliPropagation")
```

### Install from GitHub
If you want to install the latest code, you can install the package directly from the Github link.
For example, if you are working with a Jupyter notebook, run
```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/MSRudolph/PauliPropagation.jl.git", rev="branchname")
```
where you can use the keyword `rev="branchname"` to install development versions of the package.
We don't recommend using branches other than `main` or `dev`.

### Clone repository and install locally 
Navigate to a local directory where you want to clone this repository into and run the following in a terminal
```bash
git clone git@github.com:MSRudolph/PauliPropagation.jl.git
```
Inside this cloned repository you can now freely import `PauliPropagation` or install it into your environment.\
Alternatively, you can push the relative path to the cloned repository to the Julia package load path called `LOAD_PATH` via
```julia
rel_path = "your/relative/path/PauliPropagation"
push!(LOAD_PATH,rel_path);
```
This may require that you have no global installation of `PauliPropagation` in your enviroment.

### A note on julia installation 
It is recommended to install julia using `juliaup`

```juliaup add 1.10```

Go to the project directory (e.g.Â PauliPropagation.jl). To start julia for a local environment

```julia --project=./```
