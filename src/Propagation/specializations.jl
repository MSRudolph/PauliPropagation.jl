# This file contains specialized functions for some of our gates.
# We overload `applyandadd!()` to fix potential type-instabilities in `apply()` if the number of returned Pauli strings is not fixed.
# We overload `applytoall!()` to reduce unnecessarily moving Pauli strings between `psum` and `aux_psum`.
# This usually also fixes potential type-instabilities in `apply()`.
# Both functions can be overloaded if needed.

### PAULI GATES
"""
    applytoall!(gate::PauliRotationUnion, theta, psum, aux_psum, args...; kwargs...)

Overload of `applytoall!` for `PauliRotation` and `FastPauliRotation` gates. 
It fixes the type-instability of the `apply()` function and reduces moving Pauli strings between `psum` and `aux_psum`.
`psum` and `aux_psum` are merged later.

### Clifford gates
"""

Overload of `applyandadd!` for `CliffordGate` gates.
Use `set!()` instead of `add!()` because Clifford gates create non-overlapping Pauli strings.
`applytoall!` does not need to be adapted.

### Pauli Noise
"""
    applytoall!(gate::PauliNoise, theta, psum, aux_psum, args...; kwargs...)

Overload of `applytoall!` for `PauliNoise` gates. 
It changes the coefficients in-place and does not require the `aux_psum`, which stays empty.
