Create a circuit, and an accompanying list of gate parameters, which trotterises the unitary evolution operator (at time=1) of the given Hamiltonian.
Precisely, this produces a circuit approximating `exp(- i hamil)`, produced by the higher-order (as per `order`) symmetrized Suzuki-Trotter decomposition, 
using Childs-randomisation of each repetition (as per `nreps`), unless disabled by `random=false.`
The specified `order` must be 1, or an even integer, and `nreps` must be a positive integer.
This function returns tuple (circuit, params), where every gate in vector `circuit` is a FastPauliRotation with corresponding angle given in `params`.
Because time appears as a simple prefactor of every PauliRotation angle, simulating non-unity time involves merely scaling all returned `params` by the desired time.
For example, `circuit, params = trottercircuitandparams(psum, 1, 1); out = propagate(circuit, pstr, 0.5 * params)` would (approximately) evolve `pstr` to `time=0.5` under Hamiltonian `psum`.

This enables specifying commuting groups of Pauli strings in a Hamiltonian, reducing the Trotter error.

As such, Trotterisation will not interweave the corresponding rotations of terms in distinct groups, minimising the Trotter error.
