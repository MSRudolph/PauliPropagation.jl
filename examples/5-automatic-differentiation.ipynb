This is how large-scale neural networks are trained, and is commonly referred to as gradient _backpropagation_. The challenge here is that the graph for the chain rule is computed once (to the best of our knowledge), which means that only truncations during the initial computation will be respected. Truncations that we think work well here are `max_weight`, `max_freq`, and `max_sins`, as they do not depend on the particular parameters of the quantum circuit. On the other hand, which paths are explore with truncations such as `min_abs_coeff` will not be updated (again, to the best of our knowledge) as the gradients are computed.\n",
